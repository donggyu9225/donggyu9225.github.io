<h1>⏰ Time Management Skills ⏱️</h1>

<h2>Why is it important to use time efficiently?</h2>
    <p>It's very important to use time efficiently, especially as you get older. 
        As we get older, there are more things that we need to do, and there will be a lot more homework or other works to do.
        Therefore, it's important to plan out our works in prior to have the best work efficiency, and 
        possibly have some free time for ourselves, too.</p>
