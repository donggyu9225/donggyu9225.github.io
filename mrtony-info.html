<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mr. Tony Nguyen is a new teacher at Saint Paul. Coming from a varied and 
        multifaceted background, he brings a breadth of knowledge and experience for the students. Even though 
        he holds a degree in Mathematics from UC San Diego, the art and humanties have always been an interest 
        of his. An avid reader, Tony is interested in the interaction between culture, art, and technology, and 
        what that means for the lives of ordinary people. He has received his training from the California State 
        University at Long Beach, where he enrolled in their credentialing program for Art Teachers. Drawing and 
        painting continue to be a lifelong hobby of his.</p>
